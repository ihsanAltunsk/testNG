<!--
    .xml files
    Used for batch execution in TestNG.
     1- The line we write at the beginning
        should be present in all our .xml files.
        This line will execute the test methods, classes, or packages prepared with TestNG
        from the code we write in this .xml file.
     2- To determine which methods/classes/packages will run,
        we should write in our .xml file according to the test hierarchy.

     3- Test hierarchy:
        suite: contains one or more tests
        test: a structure assembled for a purpose
        consisting of test methods/classes/packages
        that we can run in a single execution
        Example: smoke test, E2E, regression
        packages - classes - test methods are at the same level.
